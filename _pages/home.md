### Welcome

I am a geoscientist investigating how Earth's atmosphere and surface interact to regulate climate over geological timescales. My research focuses on chemical weathering—how rocks break down through chemical reactions, influencing greenhouse gas concentrations. By combining laboratory experiments with fieldwork, I explore how these processes have shaped Earth's habitability and continue to affect climate today.

Recently, I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge, where I studied how ion-exchange reactions between sediment surfaces and water can influence our understanding of chemical weathering by altering the chemical composition of ground and river water. To investigate these processes, I used a range of tools, including stable and radiogenic isotopic tracers, with a particular focus on stable barium isotopes.

Currently, I am studying the climate impact of deglaciation—the melting and retreat of glaciers driven by rising temperatures. My research examines how the exposure of previously buried geological carbon stores to oxygen, as glaciers recede, can release CO₂. These processes may have hidden positive feedbacks that could intensify current climate change. To better understand these dynamics and their implications, I conduct laboratory experiments and fieldwork in the Arctic.
