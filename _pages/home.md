### Welcome

I'm Alasdair Knight, a geochemist researching chemical weathering.

Chemical weathering involves the breakdown of rock at the surface of Earth via chemical agents (e.g., water, oxygen). These reactions are thought to be vital for the habitability of Earth via the removal and release of greenhouse gases and the supply of life essential nutrients from rocks. I explore these reactions using laboratory experiments and field studies.
